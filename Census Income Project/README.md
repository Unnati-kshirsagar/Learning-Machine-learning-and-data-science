Case Study: Predicting Income from Census Data
Objective:
To develop a predictive model that predicts whether an individual makes over $50,000 a year or less based on various demographic features.

Dataset:
We are using the Census Income dataset obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains information about individuals, including age, education, occupation, and more, from the 1994 US census.

Tasks:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Understand the distribution of income in the dataset. Explore relationships between different features and income. Visualize key insights using plots and graphs.

Data Preprocessing:
Handle missing values. Encode categorical variables. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

Model Building:
Train machine learning models on the training set. Logistic Regression Decision Tree Random Forest Gradient Boosting Support Vector Machine

Model Evaluation:
Evaluate the models using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix. Identify correctly classified and wrongly classified instances for each model.

Conclusion and Recommendations:
Summarize the findings from the models. Provide recommendations or insights based on the analysis. Code Implementation: The code provided earlier covers steps 1 to 4. Feel free to execute the code in your Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab environment. For step 5, you can analyze the results, compare the models, and draw conclusions based on the performance metrics.

Additional Considerations:
Hyperparameter tuning: Experiment with different hyperparameters to optimize model performance. Feature engineering: Explore creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve model accuracy. Cross-validation: Implement cross-validation to ensure robustness of the models. Next Steps: You can further enhance the project by deploying the best-performing model in a real-world scenario or exploring advanced techniques for improving model accuracy.
